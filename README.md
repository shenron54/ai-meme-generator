# AI Meme Generator Framework

An advanced meme generation system that leverages state-of-the-art transformer models to create contextually relevant memes. The framework treats meme generation as a two-stage NLP task: template classification followed by caption generation.

## Architecture Overview

The system consists of two main components:

1. **Template Classifier**: A multi-class classifier based on transformer architectures (BERT/RoBERTa) that categorizes input text into one of 300 meme templates.

2. **Caption Generator**: A fine-tuned GPT-2 model that generates meme captions conditioned on the input context and selected template.

## Key Features

- End-to-end meme generation pipeline
- Transformer-based template classification
- Conditional text generation using GPT-2
- Support for 300 distinct meme templates
- Built using HuggingFace's transformers library

## Technical Implementation
